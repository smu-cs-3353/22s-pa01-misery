# PA 01: The Art Gallery
by Michael Doherty

Project Description
In this project, I needed to develop three algorithms that would determine the optimal subset of pictures to place on a wall such that, if all pictures were sold, it would maximize profit. All pictures are placed along the centerline of the wall, and the length and height of the wall, as well as the value, width, and height of each picture, were given to me. Thus, I created a brute force algorithm, which finds the best possible solution (but is incredibly slow at large dataset sizes), a most expensive picture first algorithm (which places the pictures on the wall starting with the most expensive first), and a custom algorithm that attempts to find a better solution than the most expensive picture first algorithm while being significantly faster than the brute force algorithm.
